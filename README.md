1-1)Constant
1-2)Linear
2)Constant - single value no matter what.
3)Quadratic - looping over two arrays.
4)Linear - Only moving a list of values to a new values.
5)Linear Sort - Sifts through the array for the given value.
6) Quadratic - Two arrays being paired up, 
7)Computes the fibonachi numbers, linear. 
8)Logarithmic
9)Constant - doesnt matter how big the array is.
10)Check to see if it is greater than 2, and is not an interger. Then finds if it is prime. Linear.
11)If you are given 5 disks, how do the rods look like after 7 recursive calls?
    -          -      -
    -          -     ---
 --------      -    -----
----------     -   -------    
How many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 3 disks? with 4 disks? with 5 disks?
7,15,31
Exponential - moves corrispond to the number of disks.
